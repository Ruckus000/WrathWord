# Local User Profile & Stats Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Successfully implemented a comprehensive local user profile system with stats tracking and a beautiful results modal, based on the provided HTML design.

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. **Local Profile System** ([src/storage/profile.ts](src/storage/profile.ts))

**Auto-Generated Profile** on first launch:
```typescript
{
  id: "uuid-generated",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  stats: {
    2: { gamesPlayed, gamesWon, currentStreak, maxStreak, guessDistribution },
    3: { ... },
    4: { ... },
    5: { ... },
    6: { ... }
  },
  preferences: {
    defaultLength: 5,
    defaultRows: 6,
    defaultMode: 'daily'
  }
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Automatic profile creation (zero friction)
- ✅ UUID generation for unique identification
- ✅ Persisted to MMKV (fast, offline-first)
- ✅ Stats tracked per word length (2-6)
- ✅ Export/import functionality (future device transfer)

### 2. **Stats Tracking**

**Per Word Length:**
- `gamesPlayed` - Total games started
- `gamesWon` - Total victories
- `currentStreak` - Consecutive daily wins
- `maxStreak` - Best streak ever
- `guessDistribution` - How many wins in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 guesses

**Automatic Recording:**
- Stats recorded immediately after win/loss
- Streak logic handles:
  - Same day (no increment for multiple games)
  - Next day (increment streak)
  - Skipped days (break streak)
- Daily mode specific tracking

### 3. **Enhanced Results Modal** ([GameScreen.tsx](src/screens/GameScreen.tsx))

Based on the provided HTML design, featuring:

**Win State:**
```
🎉
Brilliant!
5×6 · Oct 26

┌─────────┐
│ SCORE   │
│  3/6    │
└─────────┘

YOUR GUESSES
🟩⬛⬛🟩⬛
🟩⬛🟩🟩⬛
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩

🔥 Current Streak
5 days

[📤 Share Results]
[Play Again]
```

**Loss State:**
```
😔
Better Luck Next Time
5×6 · Oct 26

┌──────────────┐
│ The word was │
│    CRANE     │
└──────────────┘

┌─────────┐
│ SCORE   │
│  X/6    │
└─────────┘

YOUR GUESSES
(6 rows of colored tiles)

[📤 Share Results]
[Play Again]
```

**Dynamic Elements:**
- Emoji changes based on performance (🤯 for 1 guess, 🎉 for great, 😎 for good, etc.)
- Title varies by score ("Incredible!", "Brilliant!", "Amazing!", etc.)
- Answer reveal only on loss
- Streak display only if streak > 0
- Score color (green for win, red for loss)

### 4. **Share Functionality** ([src/logic/shareResult.ts](src/logic/shareResult.ts))

**Generated Share Text:**
```
WrathWord 5×6
Oct 26, 2024
3/6

🟨⬛⬛🟩⬛
🟩⬛🟩🟩⬛
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Emoji grid (🟩 correct, 🟨 present, ⬛ absent)
- ✅ Uses native iOS Share sheet
- ✅ Format matches Wordle style
- ✅ Includes date, configuration, score

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Test Cases

**Profile Creation:**
- [ ] Open app first time → Profile auto-created
- [ ] Check MMKV → `user.profile` exists with UUID

**Stats Tracking:**
- [ ] Win a game → Stats increment
- [ ] Check profile → gamesPlayed +1, gamesWon +1
- [ ] Win next day → Streak increments
- [ ] Skip a day → Streak resets
- [ ] Win multiple games same day → Streak stays same

**Results Modal:**
- [ ] Win in 1 guess → See "🤯 Incredible!"
- [ ] Win in 3 guesses → See "🎉 Brilliant!"
- [ ] Lose game → See answer reveal + "😔 Better Luck Next Time"
- [ ] Win with streak → See streak display
- [ ] Win without streak → No streak display

**Share:**
- [ ] Press Share Results → iOS share sheet appears
- [ ] Share text includes emoji grid
- [ ] Share text includes date and score
- [ ] Paste in Messages → Format looks good

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Multiple games same day (streak doesn't multiply)
- [ ] Change word length mid-streak (separate streaks)
- [ ] App closed mid-game (state persists)
- [ ] Daily mode rollover at midnight (new word)
