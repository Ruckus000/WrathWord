- [ ] Wire up keyboard to input handler
- [ ] Test tap targets are comfortable (min 44x44 points)

### **Phase 9: Game Logic Integration** (2 hours)
- [ ] Implement `onKey` handler:
  - Letter input (A-Z)
  - DEL (backspace)
  - ENTER (submit guess)
- [ ] Implement guess validation:
  - Check word length
  - Validate against allowed list
  - Show error feedback for invalid words
- [ ] Implement guess submission:
  - Call `evaluateGuess`
  - Update rows and feedback
  - Check win condition
  - Check loss condition (6 guesses)
- [ ] Update game status accordingly

### **Phase 10: Haptics & Accessibility** (1 hour)
- [ ] Integrate `react-native-haptic-feedback`:
  - Medium impact on valid guess submission
  - Success notification on win
  - Warning notification on loss
- [ ] Add accessibility features:
  - Proper roles for all interactive elements
  - Accessibility labels for tiles (letter + state)
  - `AccessibilityInfo.announceForAccessibility` for:

## ðŸ“Š Estimated Timeline
- **Total Development Time**: 18-22 hours
- **With testing buffer**: 25-30 hours
- **Recommended schedule**: 5-7 days (3-4 hours/day)

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria
- âœ… App runs smoothly on iOS simulator
- âœ… All 5 word lengths (2-6) work correctly
- âœ… Daily mode returns consistent words per day
- âœ… Duplicate letter logic is perfect
- âœ… Keyboard states update with correct precedence
- âœ… Haptics work on device
- âœ… VoiceOver announcements work
- âœ… Settings persist across app restarts
- âœ… No crashes or console errors
- âœ… Clean, maintainable code

## ðŸš¨ Critical Path Items
1. **Get evaluateGuess logic perfect** - This is the heart of the game
2. **Ensure word lists are complete** - No missing words or validation issues
3. **Test daily mode determinism** - Same day = same word, always
4. **Safe-area handling** - Must work on notched devices

## ðŸ’¡ Optional Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Statistics tracking (streak, win %, guess distribution)
- Share results (emoji grid copy to clipboard)
- Hard mode (revealed letters must be used)
- Color blind mode (high contrast colors)
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Animations for tile reveals
